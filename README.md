# pic_organizer_script
This script is something I worked on for a classmate. He had some requirements for how he needed to have various images on his computer sorted. From those requirements, this script was created. 
Undertaking this project gave me experience with using various libraries to extract information about images and videos and organize files according to such information. This project is data science relevant as it is another crucial aspect of data processing.
